# TODO: Fix Responsiveness Issues

## Tasks
- [ ] Edit static/css/home.css to make hero overlay text left-aligned in mobile screens
- [ ] Edit static/css/application_form.css to ensure state input and other form elements are contained in small screens
- [ ] Test changes in browser to verify responsiveness

## Notes
- Hero overlay: Change text-align from center to left in @media (max-width: 767px)
- Application form: Add width: 100% to form inputs/selects in mobile media query to prevent overflow
